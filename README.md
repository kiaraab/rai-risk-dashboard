# Responsible AI Risk Dashboard

This project is a prototype dashboard to assess model fairness and risk using open-source tools. Built with Python and Fairlearn, it evaluates how a predictive model performs across different demographic groups.

## Features:
- Fairness metrics: demographic parity, equalized odds, and more
- Visualizations of group-level precision, recall, and disparity
- Interactive elements via Streamlit (or Jupyter Notebook)

## Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Fairlearn
- Streamlit or Jupyter
- UCI Adult Dataset

## Why It Matters:
As AI systems become more embedded in decision-making, it's crucial to monitor them for unintentional bias. This project simulates a lightweight risk dashboard for internal compliance or data science teams.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python rai_dashboard.py` or open the Jupyter Notebook

## Files:
- `rai_dashboard.py` – Main script
- `data/` – Sample dataset
- `plots/` – Generated fairness visualizations
